## SLDC models: Waterfall vs Agile
### Waterfull model  
* Phases
    1. Requirements
    2. Design 
    3. implementation
    4. Verification
    5. Maintenance
* Projects progress one step at a time in a linear fashion until a project reaches maintenance
	* "one should move to a phase only when its preceding phase is reviewed and verified" 
* Pros 
	* Model places significant focus on requirements and documentation
	* Designed to catch issues as early as possible (see cost of a bug)
	* Easy to identify milestones
* Cons
	* It is difficult to know all of the requirements when a project begins
	* It is difficult to see how a project will evolve
### Agile model  
* "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."
* Pillars of Agile
	1. Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
	2. Working Software over comprehensive documentation
	3. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
	4. Responding to Change over following a plan
* There are many different implementations of the agile manifesto 
	* Scrum and Kanban are currently very popular
### Scrum
* Framework for managing work following the principals from the Agile Manfiesto
* Scrum comes as a set of guidelines to be shaped to meet a team's specific needs
	* Each teams practices evolve through sprint retros 
	* Each team's scrum is unique
* Sprints/stories/epics/spikes
	* Sprint - timeboxed iterations for work
		* For the class, we are proposing a 1 week sprint
	* Stories - A unit of work that provides value to
	* Epics - A collection of stories packed together to deliver a feature
	* Spikes - A unit of engineering research that does not deliver direct value. Typically ends with creating stories
* 4 important meetings
	1. Daily scrum (standup) - daily work update
		1. Format for update "yesterday I did A, B, and C. Today I plan to do D, E, and F. I am blocked on X,  and Person B is working to resolve it"
	2. Sprint planning - Meeting to select what work the team will complete in the current sprint
		1. The team should only pull in the work it believes.
	3. Sprint review - End of sprint meeting to evaluate progress in the sprint. Ensure all AC for completed stories were met. 
	4. Retrospective - Reflect on previous sprint, modify team's process to improve productivity. 
		1.(opinion) most teams fail to properly use retro to solve their own problems.
